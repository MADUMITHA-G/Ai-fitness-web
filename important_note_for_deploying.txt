4) Thread-safety & multi-user note (important)

This curl_counter instance is global. That means if multiple browser clients call /process_curl, they share the same counter/state. For single-user testing on localhost this is fine.

If you need per-user counters, we can:

store processor instances in a dict keyed by session['email'] or a generated session id, or

send/receive state on client side and make processors stateless.

Tell me if you want per-user isolation; Iâ€™ll provide a safe session-factory version.
